Description of Use Case
Consent2Share is a web-based application to give patients the ability to consent to share their health information with particular health care providers. The Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) sponsored the project to demonstrate Consent2Share’s capability and has made the documentation and software available for free on GitHub. The focus is towards giving patients with sensitive behavioral health data the ability to decide upon and electronically consent to sharing their data with other health professionals that conforms to the requirements put forth in 42 CFR Part 2 and FHIR. The forms can integrate within the existing health information exchange (HIE) systems allowing specific informing to be excluded from the record being sent to a health professional (i.e. redaction of substance abuse treatment).   

Consent2Share uses GitHub (link: https://github.com/bhits/consent2share) as a repository for the software code for all aspects of the program: interfaces, documentation segmentation services, FHIR integration service, etc. Additionally, it stores the user guides, development and deployment guides. It is built upon a microservices architecture so each microservice is presented separately with GitHub by domain. On the main page there is a link to a Release page that delineates what is included in each version and due to GitHub’s capability, it shows exactly who and when it was released. Consent2Share uses GitHub for version control for the software code changes and changes to any of the supporting documents.  

Where does it fall short in leveraging version control tools?
While Consent2Share utilizes a fairly straight forward implementation of GitHub’s version control, there are a few tools that it could better leverage to take full advantage of GitHub’s functionality. One of those is the transparency of comments when making changes to various versions of a document. For example, the User Guides are assumingly updated between each version (i.e. C2S Master Guide 3.4.0 is different than C2S Master Guide 3.3.0) however there are no details of what information was updated. Allowing users visibility into what update requests were made, and accepted, between various would provide more transparency to the overall version control process. 

What would you do differently? 
Within the repository, for many of the directories and subdirectories, there is not consistent verbiage to denote what exactly was done when updates were performed with the coding. For example, within the “Samples” subdirectory, the verbiage clearly states that the file names were changed for sample clinical documents, however inside the “ehr-edition” subdirectory the update comment is “fix deployment issues”. While Git does allow the viewing of a prior version of files that were changed, it would be beneficial to have a standard naming convention for update comments.

Within the project website, which is hosted by GitHub, in the “Documentation” dropdown menu there are user guides which cover many roles and versions. For the typical end user, i.e. non-technical person, viewing the project website, there is room for confusion related to the multiple versions and roles. This could be simplified by larger icons related to role and then smaller icons or hyperlinks related to the different versions. While the most recent version is listed at the top of the webpage, I would deemphasize older versions of the documentation by either decreasing the font size associated with their hyperlinks or move to another webpage altogether. 

Reviewing the repository there is no notation of testing of the application and how the application fared. Utilizing the “Find File” feature does return results within the “scripts” subfolder.  These files do not denote how the application fared during testing utilizing these scripts. If the coding is public, at a minimum there should be documentation regarding how well the application performed in testing of the most recent released version.
