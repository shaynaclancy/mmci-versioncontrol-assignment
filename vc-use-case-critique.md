Conset2Shareâ€™s use of GitHub, for version control is a good use case for numerous reasons. Consent2Share uses GitHub mostly for the software code. Using GitHub, helps Conset2Share improve its software code with contributions and collaborations from other coders while being open source code project. Consent2Share of course, ultimately decides which patches (contributions) to merge. But it does help to improve the code, rectify bugs in the code. This enables Conset2Share to continue to improve their code, to improve the website for the patients / providers using Conset2Share.

Conset2Share currently has multiple versions on GitHub. Each version has a trail of what was improved, corrected or added, as evidenced by changelog.md available on GitHub. Changelog.md shows a list of chronological changes made that will affect the end-user. This changelog is accessible to everybody, collaborating on the open source project. It shows the changes made during the last version update from critical security vulnerabilities, fixing bugs to updating the documents available to the end-users. This is a good use of the version control, from the standpoint it does give a better chronological order to the changes made, and the issues corrected.

One of the advantages of using GitHub by Consent2Share, for developers currently working on EHR, to improve HIE, can view the code available for this project. There is a sample of the CCD provided. Other developers could view this, and other aspects of this project to fork this information to initiate their new project, where a patient consents to share certain aspects of their health information to exchange with other providers in another state. And this aspect of the Consent2Share project could be utilized by other EHR systems.
